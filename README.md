  DATA SCIENCE PROJECT: BANK CUSTOMER CHURN
</h1>


## üöÄ 1.INTRODUCTION
Customer Churn prediction means knowing which customers are likely to leave or unsubscribe from your service. For many companies, this is an important prediction. Some studies confirmed that acquiring new customers can cost five times more than satisfying and retaining existing customers. Once you‚Äôve identified customers at risk of churn, you need to know exactly what marketing efforts you should make with each customer to maximize their likelihood of staying.As a matter of fact, there are a lot of benefits that encourage the tracking of the customer churn rate, for example:
- Marketing costs to acquire new customers are high. Therefore, it is important to retain customers so that the investment is not wasted
- It has a direct impact on the ability to expand the company
- Improve the customer experience
- Increase profits
- Etc

Customers have different behaviors and preferences, and reasons for cancelling their subscriptions. Therefore, it is important to actively communicate with each of them to keep them on your customer list. You need to know which marketing activities are most effective for individual customers and when they are most effective.

In this project our goal is to predict the probability of a customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques.
